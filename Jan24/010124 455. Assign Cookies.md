[Assign Cookies Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

# Intution
We would try a pattern in which we assign the cookie to the child with minimum greed-factor to the maximum greed-factor. This is the optimal way to assign the cookies,

for eg. `g=[1, 9, 4]` `s = [2, 3, 10];`

1. first we sort the array , `g = [1, 4, 9]` and `s = [2, 3 ,10]`;
2. initialize two pointer `i = 0` and `j = 0` to iterate on `g` and `s` respectively and a `count` to track the assign cookies.
3. if `g[i] <= s[j]`, means we can assign j-th cookie to i-th child, increase the count and increment `i` and `j` pointer. e.g., g[0] < s[0], so we would increment i, j and count to 1;
4. else we will increase the cookie pointer `j` till we get `g[i] <= s[j]` e.g., g[1] > s[1], so we would only j to 2 and in next iteration we would compare g[1] and s[2], as g[1] < s[2] we would assign the count to 2.

# Time Complexity: O(max(M, N) * log(max(M, N)))
where M and N are the lengths of the input arrays `g` and `s`, respectively.

Here's the breakdown:

1. Sorting `g` takes O(M * log(M)) time.
2. Sorting `s` takes O(N * log(N)) time.
3. The while loop iterates at most max(M, N) times because both pointers `i` and `j` can go up to the length of the larger array.
4. The operations inside the loop are constant time.

So, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in O(max(M, N) * log(max(M, N))).
## Space Complexity: O(1)

- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size. The sorting is performed in-place, and the additional variables (count, i, j) have fixed memory requirements. Thus, the space complexity is constant (O(1)).

# Code
```
class Solution:

	def findContentChildren(self, g, s):

		# Sort the arrays
		
		g.sort()
		
		s.sort()
		
		# Initialize count for tracking assignments of cookies
		
		count = 0
		
		# Initialize two pointers i and j to iterate on g and s
		
		i, j = 0, 0
		
		# Iterate through the arrays
		
		while i < len(g) and j < len(s):
		
		# If the size of the cookie is greater than or equal to the child's greed,
		
		# assign the cookie to the child and move both pointers
		
		if g[i] <= s[j]:
		
		count += 1
		
		i += 1
		
		# Move the cookie pointer to the next cookie, regardless of assignment
		
		j += 1
		
		return count
